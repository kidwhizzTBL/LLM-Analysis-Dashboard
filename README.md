Interactive LLM Model Comparison Dashboard
I've created a comprehensive interactive dashboard that catalogs and compares 51 of the top Large Language Models available in October 2025. The dashboard provides an intuitive way to explore, filter, and compare models across multiple dimensions.

Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard includes:

üéØ Smart Filtering System
Tag-based filters: Best for Beginners, Best for Coding, Best for Research, Free Access, Enterprise Grade, Multimodal, Long Context, Fast Speed, Budget Friendly, Open Source

Provider filters: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, xAI, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and more

Price range filters: Free, Budget (<$1), Mid ($1-5), Premium (>$5)

Context length slider: Find models by minimum context window

Speed filters: Very Fast, Fast, Medium, Slow

üìä Three Rating Dimensions
Each model is rated on a 5-point scale across:

‚≠ê Ease of Use: Accessibility, documentation, deployment simplicity
